**Challenges That I came accross with while building this django project:-** 


**Step 1:** In this step I had to modify django's inbuilt authentication model so that I can meet the task requirement. 

**Step 2:** I didn't face any difficulties.


**Step 3:** Here, my only challenge was to manage the multiple update option of bidding for the user. 


**Step 4:** I didn't face any difficulties.


**Step 5:** First of all, I had to separate the user into admin group and general user group so that a general user can't logged himself/herself into the admin dashboard. Then the real challenge came. Here I had to display two statistics charts as per the requirements. I have done it using chartjs, a JavaScript library. 


**Step 6:** I didn't face any difficulties. 


**Step 7:** As I haven't used Heruku before, so I don't know how to deploy a project on it. I own a hosting so I have uploaded the project there. I have attached the link with mail as well.

**Step 8:** Finished.
